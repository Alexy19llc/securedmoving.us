…We walked them around the house and explained everything, then got out of the way. They set to work. Honestly, I don’t know how they do it. They never stopped, not for a second. They handled everything with an almost magical combination of care and speed. All we had to do was stay out of the way. It was pretty cool. And when we arrived at the new place, it was exactly the same. They hooked up the appliances, reassembled the furniture, put every box where we wanted it, everything…They were exceptionally, outstandingly good.

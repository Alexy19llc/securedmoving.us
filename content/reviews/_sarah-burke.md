  alt: Sarah Burke Moving Review Picture
the_review: We have used many moving companies throughout all of our domestic
  and international moves, and Secured Moving was one of our best experiences.
  With other companies we were “guaranteed” a certain rate and ensured we could
  get the job done in a certain amount of time, only to have to pay a lot more
  in the end. When I spoke with Arthur, who I believe runs the business, he went
  over the details stating what needed to be taken into account, like distance
  to the truck, elevator time, and other variables, so there weren’t any
  surprises. Somehow, even going over all of the information, they were still a
  better price than some other companies, so I was skeptical we wouldn’t receive
  more charges, and only went with them because of the positive reviews. I was
  pleasantly surprised, as everything went very smoothly and the movers were
  extremely courteous. I don’t think they even took a bathroom break during the
  move. Arthur even came to the home to make sure everything was going well. I’m
  glad we went with this smaller business, and definitely had to share my
  experience/review, because it’s the reason I went with them! Five stars!!

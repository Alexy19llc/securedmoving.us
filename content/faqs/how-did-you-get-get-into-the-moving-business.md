  It was a complete accident. I was helping someone that was in need of painting
  that a good friend asked me to help. While being there I was approached by the
  owner of the building. He told me that he liked what I did. He asked what else
  I could do. I mentioned to him that I have an extensive background in many
  fields. He asked if I would like to come work for his moving company. After
  being with them for a period of time, I came to realize they did not have a
  heart for the customer. They didn't they care for the men that did the work
  either. They seemed to only care if they were paid. My heart is not in that
  kind of work. After a while of seeing that things were not changing, I felt
  that it was best to build a company with a heart for the customer and the
  movers. Since being in the moving industry, I have personally handled over
  1,000 moves while also giving great service with the best possible price. This
  is our ongoing vision, to move people with great care and affordable prices
  and to care for the movers who serve those we move.

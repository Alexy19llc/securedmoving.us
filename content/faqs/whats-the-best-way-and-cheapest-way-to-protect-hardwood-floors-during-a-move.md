  Accidents can happen even with the most careful movers. Protect your hardwood
  floors with ram board. Ram board is an inexpensive material that you can buy
  in rolls from companies like Home Depot and Lowe's. It rolls out flat and is
  reusable. Roll it out and fasten it to the floor with 2 in. painter's tape.
  That's it!

  Our crew members have on the job training. We work with them daily in all
  aspects. Moving is not just grabbing an item and putting it down. It is
  something that takes patience and attention to detail. Items are generally
  moved in the same ways depending on the area they are moved through. Our goal
  is to guide our crew members in the ways these items are moved, and to handle
  them as if they were their own.

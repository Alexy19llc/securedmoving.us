If youâ€™re considering moving to Saginaw, TX, you'll want to read this first. Here are the pros and cons of living in this great city.

There's a lot to love about living in Saginaw, TX. The weather is excellent, the people are friendly, and there's always something to do. However, there are also some downsides to living in this city. Here are ten things you'll love (and hate) about living in Saginaw, TX.

## 1. The Weather is Great! (Until it's Not)

[The weather in Saginaw and North Texas](https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/city/texas/saginaw) is one of many people's most significant selling points. You'll find a lot of comfort with Saginaw's sunny days, an average of 228 sunny days each year, until you don't! The springs here are beautiful and green. Your northeastern friends will be trudging through mud, and you'll be on the patio enjoying green, cool mornings and relaxing with family. July and August get hot, but a few of your friendly neighbors will have pools, so encourage them to fire up that grill. You can bring the cooler and condiments. Speaking of neighbors, this leads us to the next great feature of Saginaw:

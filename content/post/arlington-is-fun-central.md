Six Must See Attractions
::

::prose-wrapper
Visiting Arlington Tx might be overwhelming due to the size of the city. Let us guide you through your visit with a few fun recommendations of things to fill your day with.
 
## AT&T Stadium
Love football? How bout them Cowboys? During football season, this stadium is almost sold out every week with die hard cowboys fans filling every seat. If you know football, you’re well aware of the loyalty these fans have to the team, so it gets rowdy there to say the least.

This stadium offers [VIP tours](https://attstadium.com/tours/), including different types of tours showcasing the [art section](https://attstadium.com/tours/art-tour/), an [owners tour](https://attstadium.com/tours/owners-vip-guided-tour/), and even a [self-guided tour](https://attstadium.com/tours/owners-vip-guided-tour/). This place holds other things than football games. They hold concerts, and monster truck rallies too. A recent concert here was a [The Weeknd](https://www.theweeknd.com) concert which had seats sold out in under a week.

This should always be your first stop in this city.

## Globe Life Field
Take me out to the ballgame! Home of the Texas Rangers since 2020, this is an amazing stadium where all the games are played on artificial grass. Enjoy some
stadium hot dogs, burgers, or nachos under the incredible retractable roof, while keeping the sun out of your eyes. Both the 2020 National League Series and the 2020 World Series we're played here in 2020.

Feelin' real Texan? You can even be in the look out for other events held here, like the National Finals Rodeo that was held here in 2020.After the ballgame, or rodeo, for that matter, you can visit Loews Hotel and the ballpark village for some shopping fun.

One thing for sure, no matter what you decide to do here, it will be an unforgettable trip to the heart of Arlington!
     
## [Hurricane Harbor](https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharbortexas)
Water is the first thing I’m thinking about every Texas summer morning. How about an entire park of water with slides and rides? They host specific [holiday events](https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharbortexas/events) so the park is always switching up it’s look so you get a different feel every time you visit. There are [so many rides](https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharbortexas/things-to-do/all-rides), that it becomes hard to decide which to pick. They offer specific rides like [family rides](https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharbortexas/things-to-do/rides/family-rides), which help you and your crew stick together. They even have [restaurants](https://www.sixflags.com/hurricaneharbortexas/things-to-do/restaurants)! Seems odd for a water park, but it makes sense that you’ll probably end up hungry after a day of swimming.

## [Six Flags](https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas)
Sticking with the theme of parks, how about a good ol’ fashioned amusement park. This specific Six Flags is actually the original location in the Park’s chain. Similar to Hurricane Harbor, the park offers just about the same things like [seasonal events](https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas/events/holiday-in-the-park), [catered rides](https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas/things-to-do/all-rides), restaurants, and even [tours](https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas/store/vip-tours). The reason for that is because Hurricane Harbor is owned by Six Flags, so they’re going to offer the same things. One thing the park makes sure to do is really make you feel like you’re
getting the back-story of the ride, which makes them scarier.

## [Tails and Trails Dog Park](https://www.arlingtontx.gov/city_hall/departments/parks_recreation/parks_trails/park_finder/tails___n_trails_dog_park)

If you’re looking for a break from the busy lifestyle in the heart of Arlington and want to relax with you furry friend, this is the place for you. It's clean and safe, and has lots of trash receptacles to throw your dogs poop bags in!

For the well-trained dogs, there is a no leash section for your little buddy to run around and make new friends. The park was recently renovated in 2020, and now it covers 5.7 acres of
land inside of [Cravens Park](https://www.arlingtontx.gov/city_hall/departments/parks_recreation/parks_trails/park_finder/cravens_park), a very popular park which stretches all throughout Arlington.

Other amenities include a little biking trail, and park seating. [White Rhino Coffee](https://whiterhinocoffee.com)- This aesthetically pleasing shop is a great place to relax, drink some joe, and take pictures at. Not only do they sell coffee, but they also have more than surface level bakery food unlike most coffee shops which sets them on a pedestal. With a unique style, and interesting furniture, you’ll find more to enjoy than only what’s in your cup. On their website, they sell coffee grounds in bulk, or they [wholesale it](https://whiterhinocoffee.com/pages/wholesale) which like earlier stated, is something that other coffee shops don't typically have as an option anywhere. The [unique options](https://whiterhinocoffee.com/collections/coffee-bag-test) and good vibe of this shop lands it a place on our list.

## [Levitt Pavilion](https://levittpavilionarlington.org)
Join the over 73,000 people who have already enjoyed this venue with free outdoor live music under the stars located in the heart of Arlington!

The music is culturally diverse, and the outdoor concert series is amazing!

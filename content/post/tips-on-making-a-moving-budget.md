            description: Before you start packing boxes or calling moving companies, take some time to sit down and figure out how much you can realistically afford to spend on your move. Consider all the expenses associated with your move, such as packing supplies, moving company fees, and transportation costs.

            description: Once you have a budget in mind, start researching moving companies. Be sure to get quotes from at least three different companies to ensure that you're getting a fair price. Remember that the cheapest option may not always be the best one, so make sure to read reviews and ask for recommendations from friends and family.

Eagle Mountain Lake has been a fantastic oasis near Fort Worth, Texas for over 50 years. It was first thought of in early 1928. The[ dam‚Äôs construction ](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/surfacewater/rivers/reservoirs/eagle_mountain/index.asp)was fast completed in October of 1932. It was used was later used in World War II for the [Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake](https://marines.togetherweserved.com/usmc/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=PublicUnit&type=Unit&ID=20048). As time progressed, the Tarrant Regional Water District(link(https://www.trwd.com/eagle-mountain-lake/) took over the maintenance of this thriving attraction.¬†

Over the years Eagle Mountain Lake has grown into an oasis that attracts young and old alike. Whether you‚Äôre a fishing enthusiast, looking to camp out for a week, or wanting to check out some of the local scenery. We will check out a few spots together on this ride and see which one gets set on our ‚Äú Travel Plans‚Äù list on Google maps!

First on our stop on our list is the neighborhood watering hole, [Eagles Nest Sports Grill](https://www.google.com/search?q=Eagles+Nest+Sports+Grill&rlz=1C1CHBH_enUS829US830&tbm=lcl&sxsrf=ALiCzsZUH44biy6id6lqeswX1kzTURevHw%3A1663672691342&ei=c6EpY-rJFNCQwbkP-oqJiA0&oq=Eagles+Nest+Sports+Grill&gs_l=psy-ab.3...0.0.0.53213.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.yT3l8OgThsw#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:[[32.876965177319036,-97.4264290004363],[32.87660522268097,-97.42685759956369]]).¬†¬†This spot has it all! If you‚Äôre the kind of person that enjoys a deck to enjoy the air while having a beer year around, you will have no problems here. Not only do they have a full bar, but they will have you covered with comfort food, pancakes, or your favorite go-to burger. So maybe while you are checking out some of our upcoming spots on the list, make a pit stop for something to drink, or a quick bite. You can't go wrong.¬†

If camping, cabins, or canoeing is your thing. There are two spots that make our list on this one. If you're looking for a low-key getaway with all of the above, [Creek Harbor Fish Camp Eagle Mountain Lake](http://creekharbor.com/index.html) is your budget-friendly getaway. They have a bit of everything for a chill weekend,¬†Cabin Rental, RV & Tent Camping, Bait, Canoe, Pedal Boat & Kayak Rental, Boat Ramp, and Bank Fishing. Now if you're more the glamping type the renowned[ Sportmans Park and RV will give you that weekend lift](https://www.eaglemountainlake.com/camping-rv-parks--sportsman-s-park-and-rv-community/212) your are looking for. The gated park offers full hook-ups for RVs and tent campers. There are many amenities at the park including a swimming pool, hot tub, laundry facilities, playground, fishing pond, and much more!. With these two spots on our list, chills, and thrills all in one. So the question is, what‚Äôs holding you back?¬†

Considering that owner is from East Texas, nature is in his blood. [The Eagle Mountain Park](https://www.trwd.com/be-active/) has 400 unscathed acres. This makes for the perfect spot for hiking, running, biking, or enjoying nature for what it is. The park is open 7 days a week, so don‚Äôt let your busy schedule stop you from taking in the fresh air. If you live in the Fort Worth area it‚Äôs only a few minutes outside of your home.¬†

Pick up a new hobby and learn to scuba dive with [Raw Scuba Diving](https://www.yelp.com/biz/raw-scuba-diving-fort-worth).

For our final stop on the list, you can't come out to a lake without doing some fishing (again, an East Texan Thing)! No matter the fishing you like to do, the lake has some honey holes! With over ten boat slips around the lake, you can spot up and pick your poison (bass for Us). Now, if you don‚Äôt have a boat or rod of your own, we found a local guide that will give you a lay of the land. Mr. Catfish, Chad Ferguson of the [North Texas Guide Service runs a tight-knit operation](https://www.txcatfishguide.com/eagle-mountain-lake-catfish-guide/). With a heart for giving others an experience like no other, he will take you out, and help with everything from baiting the hook, to cleaning the catch of a lifetime! Give ‚Äôem a holler! You won‚Äôt regret it!

Now that you have a few spots that hadn't caught your eye before, what's holding you back? Getting out is better than a weekend on the couch and that fresh Texas air will do you good. ü§†

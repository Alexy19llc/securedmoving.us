We know that moving can be a huge hassle. You‚Äôre packing up all your belongings, coordinating with a moving company, and trying to figure out where everything is going to go in your new place and what you‚Äôre going to do when you get there. So we decided to ask our professional movers what makes Arlington, TX, such a great place to move in to. It turns out, they have plenty of reasons why! Keep reading for some of their top tips on making the most out of your move.

Arlington is the place to be if you‚Äôre looking for a good time with friends. From its picturesque views of the North Texas region, it‚Äôs no surprise that this city provides fun in every direction!

Whether your preference lies on horseback riding at Carter Park or playing games all day long under artificial lights at The Granite informercial center, there will always be something new around these parts. Moving to Arlington, TX, has become just a little bit easier thanks to movers like Secured Moving Company. We are known for home moves with a stress-free moving process and service that includes packing.

## What a great place to live!

The vibe in Arlington, TX, is laid back and friendly. So many activities are going on around town all at once that it‚Äôs easy not to get bored. There isn‚Äôt one thing that stands out as being more famous than another. They‚Äôre just too numerous for people from outside Arlington‚Äôs little city limits to actually have an idea of what goes down here most days (we think).

If you want your mind blown by some incredible natural beauty, head to [Crystal Canyon](https://www.arlington.org/listings/crystal-canyon-natural-area/1136/) in Arlington. The park provides visitors with an opportunity for outdoor adventures while also giving you and your family peace and quiet.

If history fascinates you almost as much as sports, head to The Legends of the Game Museum. It‚Äôs a must-see for any sports fan. With interactive exhibits and programs on nearly 100 different baseball athletes, eras, and teams, you‚Äôll be able to explore your favorite memories from yesteryear. Plan to visit this one-of-a-kind museum!

Arlington is home to one of America‚Äôs most well-known sports teams, the Cowboys. However, it also has an impressive esports venue that hosts events for gamers from all around this great country!

The stadium is home to the Dallas Overwatch League team. There are competitions, including Fortnite tournaments, where winners get massive scholarships donated by Epic Games‚Ä¶the world‚Äôs largest video game developer! So if you‚Äôre looking for some incredible live e-sport entertainment, don‚Äôt miss out. You could win free tuition or even an opportunity of working with industry giants. All this while learning new skills in front row seats, right here!

## What are the hidden gems in Arlington, TX?

The biggest secret is that it‚Äôs not a big city at all. It has just over 300k people living within its borders. There isn‚Äôt as much going outside your doorsteps as in other larger metros like New York City or Los Angeles. But don‚Äôt let this fact fool you into thinking that nothing happens here night after evening. While Arlington may be smaller than those places, its array of restaurants will make up for any loss with delicious food options!

Furthermore, this area also offers plenty more outdoor adventures such as fishing and hiking trips along [River Legacy Park](https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/boat/paddlingtrails/inland/arlington_riverlegacyparks/) or hitting golf balls instead.

Or maybe music is your thing. What‚Äôs not to love? The thriving music scene in Arlington, Texas, is one of the best! [The Arlington Music Hall](https://arlingtonmusichall.net/about/) is a great place to see live music! They have some of the best local bands and artists perform there, so it‚Äôs worth checking them out if you‚Äôre ever in town.

You‚Äôll find countless venues hosting events every night and tons more going on at local restaurants like [The Tipsy Oak](https://www.thetipsyoak.com/) & even free music venues like the great [Levitt Pavillion](https://levittpavilionarlington.org/get-involved/perform/). So grab your friends (and maybe some instruments) because it‚Äôs open mic night across town ‚Äì who knows what might happen next?!

Whether providing packing services or moving services, our professional movers do a great job getting to know the people and the places they‚Äôre moving into. We asked, and they gave us some of their favorite stops in Arlington after a hard day‚Äôs work or a fun weekend with the family:

* [Piccolo Mondo](https://www.piccolomondo.com/piano-bar) ‚Äì Perfect for date night, and the piano bar is only outmatched by its great servers and delicious food
* [Vietalis Kitchen](http://www.vietaliakitchen.com/) ‚Äì Great Vietnamese food and great reviews
* [Prince Lebanese](https://www.princelebanesegrill.com/blog-1) ‚Äì Guy Fieri says it great. Yeah, we could have told him that. The chicken shawarma alone is to die for.
* [The UTA Planetarium](https://www.uta.edu/planetarium/) ‚Äì The stars are big, the stars are bright üëèüëèüëè deep in the heart of Texas!

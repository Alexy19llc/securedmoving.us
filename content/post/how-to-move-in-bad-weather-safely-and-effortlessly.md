Moving day can be stressful enough without having to worry about bad weather. But fear not, there are ways to handle it! Here are some tips to help you prepare for moving in bad weather, without letting it dampen your spirits.

## Preparation is key

Stay up-to-date with the weather forecast and prepare accordingly. This way you can make arrangements for extreme heat, rain, or snow.

## Protect your belongings

Water can be disastrous for your electronics, so pack them correctly to protect them from rain or snow. Here are some tips to keep your items dry:

- Place small electronic devices and cables in waterproof bags.
- Ask professional movers to wrap your larger electric appliances.
- Use plastic bins instead of cardboard boxes.
- Shrink-wrap clothes and other delicate items.

## Protect your floors

Wet weather means mud and dirt, and you definitely don’t want to spend your first night in your new home cleaning. Cover doorways and entryways with old towels to keep your carpets and floors clean. Have a designated area for the movers and yourself to wipe shoes clean to prevent mud from getting everywhere.

## Clear driveways of snow and ice

If you’re moving in the middle of winter, make sure your driveway is clear of any snow and ice. This way the moving truck can access your home without delays. Use salt or sand to melt the ice and have shovels nearby just in case.

## Be cautious of slippery surfaces

Floor surfaces made from marble, tiles, and hardwood can be slippery when wet. Inform your movers of any hazardous surfaces and lay down towels or blankets for easier and safer mobility. This is to prevent you, the movers, and your belongings from falling or getting damaged.

## Use moving pads for large furniture

Moving larger household items such as sofas and mattresses in bad weather can be challenging. Ask professional movers to wrap your items with moving pads in advance to avoid getting them wet.

## Enlist the help of professional movers

Professional movers have ample experience in packing and moving items in the most treacherous weather conditions. They can give you great advice on how to handle your move and keep your belongings safe. Leave it to the movers to decide whether it’s worth moving in the bad weather or if you should wait out the storm.

## Postpone your move

If the weather is too bad, you might have no choice but to postpone the move for another day. Speak to the moving company about an alternative moving date and stay safe.

Moving to Houston can be an exciting adventure, but it's important to know what you're getting into before you make the move. One of the things that set Houston apart from other cities is its extensive transportation system.

Houston's major highways, like I-10 and I-45, provide easy access to other parts of Texas and beyond. The city is also home to two major airports: George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P.

For those who prefer more eco-friendly modes of transportation, Houston has a bike-sharing program and many bike-friendly routes and trails available throughout the city. With its flat terrain and mild climate, cycling enthusiasts will find Houston to be a great place to explore on two wheels.

The Port of Houston is another noteworthy aspect of the city's transportation system. As one of the busiest ports in the world, it plays a significant role in Houston's economy by facilitating trade with countries all over the globe.

## Houston at a Glance: Quick Facts About the City

Houston is not just any city; it's one of the largest cities in the United States, boasting an area of over 600 square miles. With more than 2.3 million people calling Houston home, it's no wonder that this big city has become one of the most populous cities in the country.

### Cost of Living

One thing that sets Houston apart from other large cities like New York City is its cost of living. The national average cost of living is significantly higher than what you'll find in Houston, making it an attractive option for those looking to move from more expensive areas.

### Diversity

Houston is also known for its diversity, with residents hailing from all over the world. Houston has been named one of the most diverse cities in America by several publications.

### Food Scene

If you're a foodie, then Houston is worth considering as your next home base. The city boasts a thriving food scene with cuisine ranging from traditional Tex-Mex to international fare.

For those who appreciate art and culture, Houston has plenty to offer as well. The city is home to several museums and cultural attractions such as The Museum of Fine Arts and The Menil Collection.

One thing that can't be ignored when talking about Houston is its weather. Summers can be hot and humid while winters are mild with occasional cold snaps. However, if you're someone who enjoys warm weather year-round then this may not be an issue for you!

## Why Move to Houston? Affordable Homeownership and Rental Apartments

### Affordable Homeownership and Rental Apartments in Houston

Houston is a city that has been attracting people from all over the world for decades. It's a bustling metropolis with a thriving economy, diverse population, and plenty of growth opportunities. But one of the most attractive features of Houston is its affordable housing options. Whether you're looking to buy a home or rent an apartment, Houston has something for everyone.

### Zoning Laws: More Housing Units

One of the reasons why Houston has such affordable housing options is due to its zoning laws. Unlike many other major cities in the US, Houston does not have strict zoning laws that limit the construction of new housing units. This means that developers are free to build more homes and apartments, which increases supply and helps keep prices down.

For example, if you're looking to buy a home in Houston, you'll find that there are plenty of options available at various price points. From cozy bungalows in established neighborhoods to modern townhomes in up-and-coming areas, there's something for every budget.

### Cost of Living: Relatively Low

Another reason why [moving to Houston can be a smart financial decision](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/dallas-tx-vs-houston-tx) is because of its relatively low cost of living compared to other major cities in the US. According to Numbeo.com, the cost of living index in Houston is 62.28 (as of August 2021), which is lower than New York City (100) and Los Angeles (84.64).

This means that residents can enjoy a high quality of life without breaking the bank. For example, groceries are generally cheaper in Houston than they are in other major cities, which can help families save money on their monthly expenses.

### Property Taxes: Lower Than Other States

In addition to its low cost of living, another financial benefit of moving to Houston is lower property taxes compared to other states like California or New York. Texas has some of the lowest property tax rates in the country, which means that homeowners can save a significant amount of money each year.

### State Income Tax: None

Perhaps one of the most attractive features of Houston for those looking to save money on taxes is its lack of state income tax. This means that residents keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets, which can be especially beneficial for those with high incomes.

If you're considering moving to Houston, it's important to keep these financial benefits in mind. Whether you're looking to buy a home or rent an apartment, Houston has affordable housing options that can fit your budget. Plus, with a low cost of living and no state income tax, you'll be able to enjoy a high quality of life without breaking the bank.

## Exploring Cultural Diversity in Houston

Houston is a city that truly embraces cultural diversity. With over 90 different countries and cultures represented in its population, Houston is one of the most diverse cities in the United States. This diversity can be seen in every aspect of life in Houston, from its food to its music to its art.


One of the reasons for this cultural diversity is Houston's focus on space exploration. NASA's Johnson Space Center is located in Houston, and it attracts scientists and researchers from all over the world who come to work on space missions. These individuals bring with them their unique cultural backgrounds and perspectives, which adds to the city's already diverse population.

[Another reason for Houston's cultural diversity is its strong focus](https://resilience.rice.edu) on education. There are over 20 colleges and universities in the area, including Rice University and the University of Houston. This attracts a diverse group of students and faculty from all over the world who come to study or teach at these institutions.

For families moving to Houston, there is a wide range of school options available that reflect the city's diverse population. There are public schools, private schools, and charter schools that cater to different needs and preferences.

Houston celebrates its cultural diversity through events like the annual Houston International Festival. This festival showcases music, food, and art from around the world, giving visitors a taste of different cultures without ever having to leave the city.

But it's not just big events like festivals that celebrate Houston's diversity - it can be seen in everyday life as well. For example, if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine or traditional Indian clothing, or African art pieces - you'll find them all here!

Houstonians take pride in their city's multiculturalism and strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome regardless of their background or ethnicity. This inclusivity can be seen in everything from local businesses that cater to specific communities (like Halal restaurants) to community centers that offer language classes for non-native English speakers.

Houston is so diverse that it's been called a "cultural kaleidoscope" by the Houston Chronicle. This diversity has not only enriched the city's culture but also its economy. Businesses in Houston have access to a global market and can cater to a wide range of customers from different backgrounds.

But it's not just about the economic benefits—cultural diversity also fosters creativity and innovation. When people from different cultures come together, they bring with them unique perspectives and experiences that can lead to new ideas and solutions.

Houston is a city with a diverse economy, offering job opportunities in various sectors. The healthcare, energy, and technology industries are just some of the many fields that are thriving in Houston. However, like any other city, there are winners and losers in Houston's job market.

[Houston's median household income](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/houstoncitytexas) is $56,019, which is slightly lower than the national median income of $70,784. Despite this difference, Houston has a lower cost of living compared to many other major cities in the United States. Housing prices are affordable, and Texas does not have a state income tax.

The energy industry has traditionally been one of the largest employers in Houston. However, due to market fluctuations and changes in demand for oil and gas products worldwide, some workers have faced layoffs. This has caused significant financial strain for individuals who were previously employed by these companies.

On the other hand, healthcare and technology jobs have seen growth in recent years. These industries offer stable employment opportunities with good salaries and benefits packages. Healthcare jobs include positions such as nurses or physicians while technology jobs range from software developers to IT support staff.

One example of a winner in Houston's job market is Memorial Hermann Health System.

Despite some challenges faced by certain industries such as oil and gas companies that have experienced layoffs due to market fluctuations, Houston’s job market continues to grow at an impressive rate attracting new businesses from around the world.

Houston’s economy also attracts entrepreneurs who want to start their businesses or expand existing ones into new markets. The city offers a supportive environment for startups, with various resources available to help entrepreneurs get started. For example, the Houston Technology Center is a non-profit organization that provides resources and support to technology startups in the area.

Houston's job market has also seen growth in the hospitality industry. With over 20 million visitors annually, Houston has become one of the top tourist destinations in Texas. This has led to an increase in demand for hotel staff, restaurant workers, and other service-related jobs.

However, not all industries in Houston are thriving. Some sectors such as retail have faced challenges due to increased competition from online retailers like Amazon. Retailers such as Sears and Toys R Us have closed stores across Houston due to bankruptcy or restructuring.

*The word invoke means to call upon something, such as a higher power or a set of rules or principles, for help, guidance, or support. It can also mean to bring to mind or to make reference to something.*{.text-3xl.font-serif}

Once upon a time, there was a young man named Arthur who had a heart for people. Arthur was inspired to start a company that had a heart for it’s customers and workers, and he was nervous because his idea was competing against the biggest companies in the area. But Arthur knew that he could call upon God for help and strength, so he prayed before he made his own big move and asked for God’s guidance and protection.

During the beginning, Arthur found himself struggling. The other moving companies were much bigger and stronger, and Arthur felt like he couldn’t keep up. But then he remembered a Bible verse that his father had shared with him: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13). With renewed faith and determination, Arthur invoked this verse in his mind and heart, trusting that God would help him and his team.

As the business developed, Arthur felt a sense of peace and confidence that he had never experienced before. He made some key moves and purchases, and he grew his business with courage and grace. His team rallied behind him, and they ended up growing the business one move at a time.

After those early days, Arthur thanked God for giving him the strength and courage to do his best. He realized that with God's help, he could overcome any obstacle and achieve great things. From that day on, Arthur made it a habit to pray before every move and to trust in God's plan for his life.

As a Christian believer, Arthur understands that invoking the power of prayer and Scripture helps him in all aspects of his life, not just in business. He continues to rely on God's guidance and wisdom as he pursues his dreams and faces new challenges, knowing that with God all things are possible.

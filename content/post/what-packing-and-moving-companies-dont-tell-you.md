Beat the Movers™

When it comes time to move, many people find the process daunting and overwhelming. Packing and moving companies help take the load off your shoulders by packing up your belongings and transporting them to your new home. However, not all packing and moving companies are created equal. Some will low-ball the time it will take to pack and move your belongings to get your business, only to surprise you with additional charges later on. Others may give you a realistic quote but then try to upsell you on services you don't need.

It's critical to be aware of the following to avoid getting taken for a ride by an unscrupulous packing and moving company:

Packing and moving companies may low-ball the time it will take to pack and move your belongings to get your business.

## The different types of packing and moving companies

There are three different packing and moving companies types: full-service, self-service, and portable storage. Full-service packing and moving companies will pack your belongings and transport them to your new home. They typically charge the most for their services, but they offer the most peace of mind. If you're worried about damaging your belongings in transit, a full-service packing and moving company is best.

Self-service packing and moving companies will provide you with packing materials and help you load your belongings onto their truck. You'll be responsible for packing everything up yourself, but you'll save money on labor costs. If you're on a tight budget, a self-service packing and moving company might be the right choice.

Portable storage companies will drop off a storage container at your home. You'll have a certain amount of time to pack your belongings and load them into the container. Once you're finished, the portable storage company will pick up the container and transport it to your new home. Portable storage is a good option if you're not in a hurry to move or need extra time to pack everything up.

Choosing the proper packing and moving company depends on your budget, timeline, and comfort level. Self-service packing and moving companies are the most affordable option if you're on a tight budget. If you're worried about your belongings in transit, full-service packing and moving companies offer the best protection for your belongings. And if you're not in a hurry to move or need extra time to pack, portable storage companies can provide flexibility.

## Avoid being taken advantage of

When packing and moving, it's essential to do your research and choose a packing and moving company that's right for you. Avoid being taken advantage of by getting multiple quotes, reading the fine print, and having a plan B. With a little bit of planning, you can make sure your packing and moving experience is as smooth and stress-free as possible.

When looking for a packing and moving company, it's crucial to ask for referrals from friends and family. They'll be able to recommend a company that has given them a positive experience. If you don't have any referrals, check online review sites like Yelp or Google Reviews to get an idea of what other people are saying about

### Get multiple quotes

When you're packing and moving, it's vital to get multiple quotes from different packing and moving companies to help you compare rates and services to find the best deal. Make sure to get quotes from at least three packing and moving companies before making your final decision.

### Read the fine print

When you're packing and moving, read the fine print of your packing and moving contract. Being thorough will help you avoid any hidden fees or charges. Ask about packing materials, storage fees, and transportation costs. Ensure that the packing contract is a binding (flat rate by the hour) contract (not to exceed) so that packers and movers don't charge for more hours than agreed.

### Have a plan B — this will help you avoid any stressful surprises

When packing and moving, it's always a good idea to have a plan B. Ensure a backup plan for transportation, storage, and packing materials. If something goes wrong with your packing and moving company, you'll have other options.

Packing and moving can be a stressful experience, but it doesn't have to be. You can avoid being taken advantage of by doing your research, getting multiple quotes, reading the fine print, and having a plan B. With a little bit of planning, you can make sure your packing and moving experience is as smooth and stress-free as possible.

### Read the contract carefully — this will help you avoid any hidden fees or charges

When you're packing and moving, read the fine print of your packing and moving contract. Be sure to ask about packing materials, storage fees, and transportation costs. Make sure that the packing contract is binding.

### Don't be afraid to negotiate

Don't be afraid to negotiate when hiring a packing and moving company. If you're not happy with the rates or services, speak up. Packing and moving companies are often willing to negotiate rates and services to get your business. So don't be afraid to ask for a better deal

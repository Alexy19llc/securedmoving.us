The Incredible Journey of Parker’s City’s First Residents
::

::prose-wrapper
## Upbringings of a Small Time Town 
The town’s first residents were originally from [Georgia](https://georgia.gov), and named their new home Parker’s city. They began by building a postal office, and a stop by the [Texas & Pacific Railroad](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-and-pacific-railway). It was later given the name [Aledo](https://www.aledotx.gov), being named after a town in [Illinois](https://www.illinois.gov) by a railroad executive.

Sometime around the 1880s, this little bit of land had about 150 residents, and by the time it got to the year 1915, this town was up and running with a bank, cotton gin, and corn mill. They almost quadrupled in size at the time with roughly 400 residents between the years 1915 and 1920.

## A Day in the Life
Aledo has an old fashioned, rustic essence in the air. It’s almost as if you asked a New York native what he imagined an older country city in Texas looked like and what he imagined came into fruition.

Like most cities, Aledo has a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/CityOfAledo/), where they post things to keep their neighbors in check, and simple community updates. This just goes to show how much of a close knit bunch this little town is.

## Favorite spots
[Bistro 1031](https://www.bistro1031.com)- This dining establishment has a wonderful family environment. They specialize in angus burgers, Braised Short ribs, and even have an award winning [filet mignon](https://www.nationalrestaurantshow.com/fabi-awards)! In addition to the outstanding food, they have an extensive wine collection to choose from.
      
[Parks of Aledo Trail](https://www.wmbctx.com/trails.html)- Within a 2 hour ride through the DFW metro area, these 35 different multi use trail routes will give you a great start to your day. The trail is managed by 17 different municipal, state and federal governmental entities.
